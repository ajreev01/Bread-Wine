### Small Details About A Small Page

```
This project is my very first web-page. I wanted to create a simple web-page that showcased what I've been learning in Code Louisville. I wanted to make a mock web-page for my church as a way to reach people looking for a new church home. This web page includes HTML, CSS & a bit of JavaScript.

Bread & Wine introduces a few web pages that attempt to give visitors a quick overview of the gospel story which includes our separation from God the Father due to sin as well as our redemption and reconciliation through God the Son.   

Bread & Wine also contains a small form that users can submit to get in contact with a local pastor so that they are able to find a new church home.

```

### Selected Custom CSS Classes

```
#main-nav - This Id defines the style details of the navigation bar located at the top of the viewport on all pages of site.

#contact - This Id is responsible for targeting form of 'contact' section of web page.

.zoom - this class increases the size of the elements in the navigation bar using 'transform' properties when the user hovers over it. This helps draw more attention to a specific navigation link.

```

### JavaScript Functions
```
revealMessage - When the user clicks on 'remember' button on contact page, the message hidden within will be revealed.

The click listener for button containing an anonymous function centers viewport to contents of revealMessage button by scrolling to the top of the hiddenMessage element.
